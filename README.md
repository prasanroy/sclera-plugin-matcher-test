# Sclera - Regular Expression Matcher

Enables Sclera to efficiently and flexibly analyze ordered streaming data.

The component introduces a construct that enables matching regular expressions over streaming data, and using them to compute sophisticated aggregates. This is a powerful construct, proprietary to Sclera, and enables computations that are ridiculously hard to express and expensive to compute using standard SQL.

For details and examples on using these constructs in a SQL query, please refer to the [ScleraSQL Reference](https://scleradb.com/docs/sclerasql/sqlextordered/) document.
